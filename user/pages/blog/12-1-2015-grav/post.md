I'd been meaning to get around to writing about how to make a web site and I guess that time is now. I always thought making a web site would be very easy but I was wrong! I had some help to get this one set up - the 'hosting' thing was too complicated for me to understand and I wanted to get this website up and running as fast as I could.

I like the editing to put in my stories and photos etc. Also, the way you add entries to my site is a bit different to many sites out there. It doesn't have a database 'because that would be too difficult. Instead, I just create a folder on my Mac mini and in there I put all the images that I want for a certain post. Finally, I create a simple text file called post.md in Sublime Text and I write my article using Markdown.

Though I've done html & css in CoderDojo, it takes a lot of work just to create a simple amount on the screen. Instead my website uses a 'language' called Markdown which is way easier and lets me  get on with writing the post.

You can still do **bold** or *italics* simply, like in html. For **bold**, just surround your word with double-asterisks, and single astericks for italics. For bullet lists just by using a single asterisk per line in front of your list. I find this way easier to remember than html.

The whole system is called Grav and is 'open-source' which means it's also free to use!
