Recently I went up to Dublin for the day with my family to the Dublin Maker. I was excited as I have never been to the festival before and I was very curious!

For those of you who have no idea what the Dublin Maker is, it is a festival of sorts celebrating and showcasing some of the interesting things happening in technology in Ireland. It is specially geared towards getting young kids interested in technology. The festival this year was on the Trinity College's Physics Lawn. 'Makers' showcase their projects and are free to talk to about whatever area of technology they specialise in.

When my family and I walked down the path to the Physics Lawn we could already see lots of small kids lining up getting ready to set off their rockets with the Institutes of Physics Ireland. From the moment we got inside the festival to where the magic was, we were immediately engulfed by the large crowds.

First off was 'The Future Of Food' which looked like weird, modern greenhouses. Turns out I was sort of right, Urban Farm and Belvedere College used hydroponic systems for growing food without soil. To do this they used LED lights, recirculated hydroponic systems and materials found in your local hardware shop.

One of my favourite parts of the day was at the Intel tent. Intel sponsored
Dublin Maker this year. The tent was showcasing the Intel Galileo and Edison
boards.

>Galileo & Edison boards; line of Arduino-certified development boards based on Intel x86
architecture and is designed for the maker and education communities.

They're an interesting topic so maybe someday I will do a post on them. Anyways, at the Intel tent my brother and I got talking to a pretty cool guy who works at Intel. He had his own robot there and it was really cool. My brother was there as part of the Maynooth tent with his own robot, you can check out his robot [**here.**](http://gregorykelleher.com/blog/maker_faire)

All in all I had a really good time at Dublin Maker, the only thing that sort of bothered me was the lack of teenage girls there. I see a lot being done to encourage stem for girls but it was disappointing to feel like I was the only girl there my age who had any interest. Although there were many young girls who were building and creating so it was nice to see a somewhat bright future in stem for girls emerging right in my home country.

Before I leave here is a video by Virealism of DublinMaker this year, please give it a view.
