Recently I wrote an answer to a Quora question about living with a incurable disease. Something a lot of you might not know about me is that I live with Diabetes Type 1 and Ceoliacs disease. I was diagnosed back in 2010 when I was ten and have had diabetes for five years now. I use pump therapy. Diabetes is a very complicated and difficult disease and takes a very long time to explain. If you have any other questions about it, feel free to tweet me @Siofra_Kelleher

I've been fortunate enough to have been diagnosed in 2010 with diabetes type 1 and coeliac disease. They're not terminal and I will be forever grateful for that fact.
But that doesn't mean it doesn't affect me. It is a constant battle with swinging sugar blood levels that send my moods swinging also. Along with being a teenager this makes me a difficult person to live with. I use an insulin pump that is a small mp3 player sized device that administers insulin to my body (the hormone that my pancreas no longer makes for me) I also have to check my blood glucose multiple times a day. If my sugars go too high I am thirsty, grumpy, have difficulty concentrating and tired. If my sugars go low, I'm shaking, sweating, dizzy and again, very tired. I have to keep my sugars within range as low and high sugars for a long period of time will cause long term damage that can result in me losing my sight or a limb etc. It's painful, stressful and time-consuming. And it's every day, every hour, for the rest of my life.


Ceoliacs means I cannot eat gluten which is found in barley, rye and wheat. If I accidentally eat gluten, I will have hours later chronic stomach pains and long term damage to my digestive system. So I am left with the gluten-free options of the foods I cannot eat, these usually are tasteless and rather gross.

I've lived with these illnesses for five years but I still struggle. There is, of course, no cure and the treatment is revolutionary but not perfect. Most days I can joke about them and just do my best that day to have a good day. But sometimes when you wake up with low or high sugars and you can't move out of bed (and not for the good reasons) I just don't want to face the day. Some days I just would much rather sit there and yell or cry or scream about how unfair it is and not deal with it all but I just can't. Diabetes and coeliac will never let me do that. No matter how much I want to eat this or that I have to tell myself that I shouldn't and I won't. Of course being a 'kid' other kids don't always accept my problems. Many a time I've had rude comments or food shoved in my face. This is all just a part of it though.

Although it's all very sad I wake up everyday hoping to improve and keep my thoughts positive. Because with incurable diseases you need a lot of courage and a lot of hope. I am proud that I can take care of myself and am able to joke about my disease. I am grateful to my parents and my friends who are both very supportive and helpful. I'm telling you this now, if you ever meet someone with a disease that they are fighting, acknowledge it. Praise them because people who are fighting these battles are some of the strongest people you'll ever meet.
